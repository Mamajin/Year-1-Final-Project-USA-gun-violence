# Year 1 Final Project: USA-gun-violence for Computer Programming 2

## Description
This project is a Database Navigator for the USA Gun Violence Record. 
This program will use tkinter on python as the main programming language for 
the entire project. This project will allow the user to see the relationship of 
the collected data in the events, where they mostly happened, at what age the 
shooters usually are, etc. This program will have an interactive UI design for 
the user to be able to see the relationship between data. The UI will also have 
some graphs such as scatter graph, bar, graph, pie graph, histogram, etc. about 
interesting information that I found to be useful to the user interested in this topic. 
This program will be used to see whether at what age most of the criminals are. 
Exploring the Relationship Between Shooter Age and Incident Severity. Investigate 
how the age of the shooter influences the severity of gun violence in the USA.
